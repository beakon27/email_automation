# Human-like Email Scheduling Context

## Purpose

This document outlines the approach for implementing a more natural, human-like pattern for scheduling and sending emails in the Beakon Solutions platform. The goal is to make automated email campaigns appear more authentic and reduce the likelihood of being flagged as spam.

## Problem Statement

Current automated email systems often send emails at perfectly regular intervals (e.g., one email every 5 minutes), which:
- Creates an obvious pattern that email providers can detect as automated behavior
- Increases the likelihood of being flagged as spam or promotional content
- Reduces deliverability and engagement rates

## Human Email Sending Patterns

When humans send emails, they typically:
1. Send in bursts (e.g., several emails in quick succession when actively working)
2. Take breaks of varying lengths between sending sessions
3. Have periods of higher and lower activity throughout the day
4. Typically don't send emails at perfectly consistent intervals
5. Often have "working hours" when most emails are sent
6. May occasionally send emails outside of working hours, but at a reduced frequency

## Proposed Solution: Variable Delay Scheduling

Instead of using fixed intervals, we'll implement a variable delay system that mimics human behavior:

### Example Pattern (within a 24-hour period):
- Send initial batch (1-3 emails) when campaign starts
- Pause for 30-90 minutes (simulating other work activities)
- Send a larger batch (5-10 emails) with small random delays between them
- Take a longer break (2-4 hours)
- Send a small batch (1-3 emails)
- Take a medium break (30-90 minutes)
- Send another medium batch (3-5 emails)
- And so on...

### Scheduling Rules:
1. **Clustering**: Emails are sent in natural clusters rather than at fixed intervals
2. **Variable Delays**: Time between emails varies significantly
3. **Working Hours**: Most emails are sent during business hours (configurable)
4. **Daily Limits**: Respect the total daily sending limits while spreading emails naturally
5. **Randomization**: Add slight randomization to all scheduled times

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Components:
1. **Schedule Generator**: Creates human-like scheduling patterns based on parameters
2. **Batch Configuration**: Defines cluster sizes and frequency
3. **Time Window Settings**: Sets preferred sending windows (e.g., business hours)
4. **Pattern Templates**: Pre-configured sending patterns (e.g., "Aggressive", "Conservative", "Balanced")

### Scheduling Algorithm:
- Start with a campaign start time
- Generate clusters of varying sizes (1-10 emails)
- Insert variable-length gaps between clusters
- Apply small random variations to individual email times
- Ensure the schedule complies with daily sending limits
- Adjust schedule to prioritize business hours (if configured)

### User Configuration Options:
- **Sending Style**: Choose from predefined patterns or create custom
- **Business Hours**: Define time windows for peak sending activity
- **Maximum Cluster Size**: Set maximum number of emails in a single burst
- **Aggressiveness Level**: Control overall sending frequency within limits
- **Weekday Preference**: Prioritize certain days for higher volume

## Benefits

- Higher deliverability rates through more natural sending patterns
- Reduced chance of triggering spam filters
- More authentic appearance to recipients
- Better campaign performance metrics
- Flexible configuration to meet various use cases and industries

## Example 24-Hour Distribution

For a campaign with 50 emails per day limit:
- Morning (8am-12pm): ~20 emails in 3-4 clusters
- Afternoon (12pm-5pm): ~20 emails in 3-4 clusters
- Evening (5pm-10pm): ~10 emails in 1-2 smaller clusters
- Night/Early Morning: Minimal to no sending

This approach significantly improves the natural appearance of email campaigns while still ensuring the desired volume of emails is delivered within appropriate timeframes.
